    """mach_frict is a function translated directly from the Caltrans SRMD postprocessing protocol (original code in MatLab). It calculates the correction for friction forces only. 
    
    Inputs: 
        vel                - velocity array for the specified degree of freedom. The default is in the X-Direction
        OutriggerMeanForce - array of the mean over the 4 outriggers force readings
        CompForce          - array of total compression force mearsured over time defined as the Compression Force fbk channel
        LiftPressure       - Default set to 1300, but varies from test to test (not all information was available, so it is held constant)
        dof                - specifies the dof for the test run 0:5 denoting X, Y, Z, Roll, Pitch and Yaw (default 0=X/horizontal)
        ActualTareWt       - Effective weight of the empty table. (Default value set to that in the original protocol)
        
    Outputs:
